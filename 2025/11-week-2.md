# Week of November 10-16, 2025

## 🚀 What We Built This Week

### Infrastructure & Organization
**Consolidated development workspace**
- Unified 15+ repositories into single monorepo structure

- Set up multi-device sync strategy via GitHub

**GitHub organization & security**
- Audited all repositories for visibility and access control
- Secured 100% private repository strategy for client work
- Analyzed which projects could serve as public portfolio pieces

### Strategic Planning
**Company structure documentation**
- Mapped project hierarchy across three business units
- Documented tech stack and integration architecture

**Public presence strategy**
- Researched GitHub profile best practices for agencies

### Tools & Automation
**File organization systems**
- Evaluated automation tools for large-scale file management
- Researched rule-based organization frameworks
- Designed configs for automated file workflows
